https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1539473929
based on the 1.1 version by Macca
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2048955709

- Added an 1x2-size shelf as well
- Food cannot be forced consumed from the shelves as they are technically in an inaccessible spot. Pawns will however still pickup and eat food by themselves.
